•Developed a Streamlit-based web application for mental health support with real-time AI conversation capabilities using
Ollama’s LLaMA3 language model.

•Implemented session-based chat history management using st.session_state to maintain context-aware responses throughout
the interaction.

•Engineered AI-driven features like positive affirmation generation and 5-minute guided meditations using prompt-based
querying with a local LLM.

•Optimized user interaction flow with asynchronous response handling via Streamlit's spinner and layout controls (columns,
buttons, markdown) for smooth UX.
